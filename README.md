chalkboardtheme_plone
=====================

Chalkboard theme from WordPress, applied to Plone 4.3.2 using Diazo.  

This currently shows the Plone content object's title, body, and byline, as well as the right portlet column.  

Everything else is hardcoded – sorry :) – please contribute your improvements!
